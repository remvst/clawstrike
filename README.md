# CLAWSTRIKE

**CLAWSTRIKE** is my entry for 2025's [JS13K](https://js13kgames.com/).
The theme for the competition was **Black Cat**.

The game is a 2D die and retry platformer. Your goal is to clear all the levels as quickly as possible by triple striking all the humans.

> Avenge your fallen human and cut through waves of enemies across fast-paced, punishingly fun levels. CLAWSTRIKE is a die-and-retry action game: youâ€™ll fall often, but each retry is instant, keeping the momentum alive.
>
> Prove your skill and unlock 9 Lives Mode by completing the game.

You can play the game at https://meow.tap2play.io/

## Song generation

GPT-5 was used in order to generate the song. All the prompts and scripts can be found under `ai/`.

In order to generate a new song, you'll need an API key, and add it to your `.env`:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

Then run `npm run songwriter`. **This will cost a significant amount of tokens. Please don't burn the entire rainforest to generate songs.**

Song definition can then be found in `ai/out`, which you can then import in Sonant-X Live.
